# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
    PyBer, Ride Sharing App Company would like to create DataFrame and 
    multiple-line chart among different city types (Rural, Suburban and Urban) 
    using Python. The result of the analysis can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
    
# Purpose 
    - To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and
      multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

# Results 
    Based on the summary of the DataFrame by city types (Please refere the DataFrame); Rural cities had the lowest number of rides, drivers and total fares as compared to SubUrban and Urban. The summary shows that Urban Cities have close to 5x and 31X more drivers than Suburban and Rural, respectively. Similarly, Urban city type received the highest number of rides and fares among city types. However, Rural cities scored the higher average fare per ride and avergae fare per driver than other cities. 

    Multiple-line chart also shows that Urban Cities had higher total weekly/monthly fares than Suburban and Urban cities. In weekly bases the 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for all cities.  
   
# Summary 

People in Urban city use more ridersharing, it is profitable, and the company should be invested more for the future. Unlike Urban cities riders are discouraged due to higher fare in rural cities. Therefore, many drivers are needed in Rural cities to increase the revenue and to balance the demand of riders. Further research is necessary to access the effect of distance and time on total fare and driver numbers on city types.
